# Hands-on session 4: Apache Maven & jinterface

In this session, the next topics are covered:

- Java project management with Maven.
- Maven in Intellij IDEA.
- Management of dependencies in application deployment.
- The package JInterface for Java-Erlang interaction.
- Exercises with Maven.

## Required software

For this session it is required to have installed:

- Java SDK 11. (*)
- Apache Maven 3.x version. (*)
- Erlang OTP. You can install the Erlang OTP from [here](https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-latest-erlang-on-ubuntu-linux/), given that you are usig Ubuntu}. Given that you are using Ubuntu. 
- An IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, Netbeans)
- [Terminator](https://linuxhint.com/install-terminator-ubuntu-22-04/) terminal.(This one is optional).

Also, do not forget to define the following environment variables:

- `M2_HOME` -> root directory of your Maven installation.
- `JDK_HOME` -> root directory of your JDK installation.
- Update the `PATH` environment variable by adding the `bin` directories of your JDK and Maven installations.

(*) You can avoid doing all these step manually by installing
[SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/).

**Make sure Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd) is running.**
Try this command on your [Terminator](https://linuxhint.com/install-terminator-ubuntu-22-04/)  to check the status of the epmd:
```bash

 ps ax | grep epmd

```
## Jinterface installation

Install into your Maven local repository the jinterface dependency:

```sh
mvn install:install-file \
   -Dfile=/usr/lib/erlang/lib/jinterface-1.13/priv/OtpErlang.jar \
   -DgroupId=com.ericsson \
   -DartifactId=erlang-jinterface \
   -Dversion=1.13.1 \
   -Dpackaging=jar \
   -DgeneratePom=true
```

## Exercise 03: Hello from Erlang!
## Part One (Communication between two Erlang Nodes: The Server and the Client Nodes).

Enter to the "erlang_files" directory and compile all erlang files

```bash
  cd erlang_files
  erlc *.erl
```

To start the Hello Erlang Server process:(Open a terminal and run the following command).

```bash
  erl -name hello_server@127.0.0.1 \
      -setcookie 'hellocookie' \
      -s hello_server init \
      -noshell
```

The server process should display the following message:

```bash
  Registered MailBox alias: "HelloMailBox" for PID: <0.9.0> 
  hello_server: waiting for new messages... 
  
```
To start the Cleint process:( Open an other terminal and run the following command ).

```bash
erl -name hello_client@127.0.0.1 -setcookie 'hellocookie'
```

After the connection is established between the Server and the Client process. The client can send data to the server as follows.
Client to send message (NB: dont forget the ðŸŸ¥dotðŸŸ¥ at the end of the command, it is part of the erlang  syntax):

```bash 

{'HelloMailBox', 'hello_server@127.0.0.1'} ! {self(), "Tesfaye Yimam"}.

```
Finally the client can read the message as follows:
Client to read a message:

```bash
receive T -> T end.
```
Then you will the client will receive a message that seems the following:

```bash

```

For Lab 04 you can follow similar steps and update the the variables accordinglty.
Update some configuration variables (i.e: serverName, serverMailBox, etc.) in the it.unipi.dsmt.javaerlang.Exercise03 java class and run it.
## Exercise 04: Cookie Quotes Server
## Part One (Communication between two Erlang Nodes: The Server and the Client Nodes).
Enter to the "erlang_files" directory and compile all erlang files

```bash
  cd erlang_files
  erlc *.erl
```

To start the Hello Erlang Server process open a terminal and run this command:

```bash
  erl -name quotes_server@127.0.0.1 \
      -setcookie 'abcde' \
      -s quotes_server init \
      -noshell
```
The server process should display the following message:

```bash
Registered MailBox alias: "QuotesMailBox" for PID: <0.9.0> 
Loaded quotes: ["A new outlook brightens your image and brings new friends.",
                "Conquer your fears. Otherwise your fears will conquer you.",
                ...
                "Lets get that bread today.",
                "Stop worrying and take a chance."] 
quotes_server: waiting for new messages... 

```
For the Client, open an other terminal and run the following command.

```bash
erl -name quotes_client@127.0.0.1 -setcookie 'abcde'
```
As the above command opens a new erlang node, you can now send a data to the server node y running the following command from the Client Node.

```bash
{'QuotesMailBox', 'quotes_server@127.0.0.1'} ! { self(),"Tesfaye","Yimam"}.
```
As a result, you will see a message similar to the following from the client Node:

```bash
{<0.86.0>,"Tesfaye","Yimam"}
```
And from the server Node you will see something similar like this one:
```bash
quotes_server: incoming message from "Tesfaye" "Yimam" (<8498.86.0>) 
```
Now, to receive the randomly generated quote you can run following command on the client Node( Dont forget the dot at the end of the Command!):

```bash
 receive T -> T end.
```
As a result of the above command you will see something similar to the following in the client's terminal.

```bash
 {ok,"Hello Tesfaye Yimam, this quote is for you: The only way to have a friend is to be one."}
```
 
## Part Two (Communication between two Nodes: The **Erlang Server** and the **Java Client** Nodes).

The above steps are to send data from two Erlang Nodes( one the server and the other the Client Node). 
Now it is time to try to connect from the Java Client Node to the Erlang Server Node.
Step 1: Go compile the maven project by clicking on the compile lifecycle. 
Step 2: Once the target directory is generated  open a terminal and cd to the target dir. Run this command
```bash
java -jar java_erlang.jar 
```
Then you will be prompted to enter your firstname and lastname:
```bash
Enter your firstname: Tesfaye   
Enter your lastname: Yimam
```
Hence form the java node you will see a message as follows:
```bash
Sending message to the server ...
```
Finally, the Erlang Server Node will send a random quote to the Java Client that looks like this one:

```bash
{ "Hello Tesfaye Yimam, this quote is for you: Come back later. I am sleeping (yes, cookies need their sleep, too).."}
```
This is the  end of the lab!
